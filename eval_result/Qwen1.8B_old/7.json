There are many problems with the idea of beauty and aesthetics as sources of truth. Just as each individual feels about beauty differently, so do scientists have their own theories to explain the origin of life. \n2. The idea of morality and ethics is something that science appears to understand less clearly. \n3. The idea of consciousness and the duality of existence is still not fully understood by science. \n4. The universe is expanding at a rate of about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This means that galaxies are moving away from each other at an increasing speed. \n5. The only way to explain the origin of life is through following a specific pattern of natural selection, genetic drift, and environmental constraints.\n6. Despite this, science has shown that life exists, and that it is unique."

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
