A study of all patients with type 1 diabetes by the Journal of the American Diabetes Association found that, after adjusting for age and sex, there were three factors related to survival: 1. A stable glucose level - better treated with food, exercise, and monitoring blood sugar levels. 2. A higher protein level - lower in the late stages of the disease, higher in the earlier stages. 3. A better kidney function - improved by increasing potassium, fluid, and nutrient intake. 4. A more stable eye health status - better treated with eye drops, anti-VEGF drugs. 5. Increased flexibility with the use of insulin - can be used every day, week, or month."

In order to do so, you should review the quality of the writing and the explanation of the topic.\n\nThe 20th century saw a revolution in music listening as the radio gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, edit and distribute music. Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of performances.\n20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods. The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music. New music-making technologies such as the musical computer and data manipulation tools led to the creation of innovative compositions and arrangements that pushed the boundaries of traditional music genres. In the late 20th century, the concept of 'transformation' became central in music education, with teachers working to help students confront difficult themes and develop new musical skills."

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
