Measures for characterizing and monitoring structural properties, however, have not been developed. In this work, we propose neural persistence, a complexity measure for neural network architectures based on topological data analysis on weighted stratified graphs. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we show that neural persistence reflects best practices developed in the deep learning community such as dropout and batch normalization. Moreover, we derive a neural persistence-based stopping criterion that shortens the training process while achieving comparable accuracies as early stopping based on validation loss.", "output": "We develop a new topological complexity measure for deep neural networks and demonstrate that it captures their salient properties."}

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "output": "Prompt Waywardness: Unraveling the Enigmatic Behavior of Discrete Interpretations of Continuous Prompts in NLP Models"}

One person gets stuck in the only way in or out of an enclosed space, such as a cave. Water starts rising in the cave due to high tide or heavy rainfall. Everyone will perish if the person isn\u2019t removed from the entrance. There is no way of removing the person who is stuck so that the individual will survive.", "output": "Facing such a harrowing ethical dilemma, the group must grapple with the agonizing decision between sacrificing one individual for the greater good or risking the lives of all involved. Those inclined towards utilitarian ethics may opt to prioritize the survival of the majority by choosing to eliminate the person trapped in the cave. Conversely, proponents of the sanctity of each individual life would vehemently oppose such a choice, viewing it as morally reprehensible. If the group ultimately decides to make the difficult decision to sacrifice one person, it is imperative that they do so in the most humane manner possible, such as through euthanasia."}

Solve for y = 7 - x, substitute into 2x + 3(7-x) = 16. Simplify to x = 5, revealing she practices speaking for 3 hours on 2 days."}

He consumes 1500 calories on some days and 2000 calories on other days. In a week, he consumes a total of 13000 calories. How many days does he consume 1500 calories?", "output": "For a detailed mathematical solution, we can represent the number of days David consumes 1500 calories as x and the number of days he consumes 2000 calories as y. As there are seven days in a week, we have the equation x + y = 7. Additionally, given that he consumes a total of 13000 calories in a week, we can form the equation 1500x + 2000y = 13000. By solving these equations simultaneously, we find that David consumes 1500 calories for 2 days in a week."}
