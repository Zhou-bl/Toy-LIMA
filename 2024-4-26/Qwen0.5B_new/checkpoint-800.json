The main goal of FFF is to solve the equation x(u,v) = y(u,v) for all values of u and v, without using a closed form solution. FFF is based on the idea of applying linear transformations to the equation to create a finite element space, where the solution can be efficiently computed. The resulting elements are typically efficient enough to handle large problems, making FFF a powerful tool for solving a wide range of applications."
