Opponents take turns serving while holding court, with each serving player making two attempts at winning the point first. Opponents can receive serve return errors before serving their own ball, which allows them to score the point. Serve serves are hit with a speed of around 25 mph each, while serve return errors occur when players try to interfere with each other. Serve returns give opponents the opportunity to score point, while serve return errors lead to points for their opponents. Serve returns are critical for the game, as they directly contribute to the outcome of the game. Serve return errors are less common on serve returns, as courts are usually relatively small for this. Serve return errors, when present, can have dramatic consequences on the outcome of games. Serve return errors can lead to points for opponents who manage to make the error before their competitor returns their serve. Serve return errors, when present, can cause teams to lose their leads at a crucial moment and lead to even more points for their opponents. Serve return errors are difficult to avoid for beginners as they struggle to keep their ball at eye level. Serve return errors can greatly influence the future outcome of games,"

The Walt Hanselman family got sued over infringing on the copyrighted material of the Ideal Toy Company's products. The lawsuit brought Walt Hanselman to his attention. Walt Hanselman realized that his company's products were infringing upon its competitor's intellectual property. So he closed down the company and decided to start a new production company that would challenge the unfairing of the patents of the Ideal Toy Company's products.\n\nThen Walt Hanselman's wife took a job with Disney. She had no interest in being associated with a competitor's intellectual property. Walt Hanselman decided to partner with them and get out from under the patent disputes. Walt Hanselman and his wife founded a company named Walt Disney Productions. Walt Hanselman retired from all of his employment. He spent all his retirement money trying to challenge the patents of the Ideal Toy Company's products. His company's inventions did not help much. But Disney's successful efforts did.

Many serial killers were able to abscond with their victims' identities and other personal information. This allowed them to perpetrate numerous murders and disappear after leaving the scene without facing consequences. Additionally, the lack of accountability for large-scale and recurring crimes further encouraged their behavior. There was little pressure to investigate and prosecute their actions, leading them to operate undetected and underlit. Finally, the economic and criminal underworld of their murders gave them cover. They could use their influence and resources to intimidate and threaten witnesses who tried to expose their crimes. Their victims' identities and wealth were not a big concern to them as long as they got their way and continued their reign of terror unchecked."

You are free to draw loops around the edge (but do so at the beginning and end) and inside the gaps as needed.\n\nI hope this helps to get you started on your hopscotch game!"

This means that variables that are more likely to have higher values in the model may not properly represent the data. Another issue is that the model may not be easily computable to perform calculations on. This can make it difficult to implement the model in a model checker or computer-based algorithm for inference. Lastly, using a symmetric probability distribution can lead to biases if not properly interpreted. For example, if a specific goal is to predict the effect of a new policy change, the model may not be able to account for potential interactions that lead to unexpected outcomes. Finally, a symmetric probability distribution can lead to numerical problems when calculating probabilities due to its symmetry."

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise?

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
        "output": "Mathematics has had a powerful influence on the visual arts through its application to sculpture, architecture, painting, glassblowing, textiles, and graphic design as a visual language. Artists and craftsmen have used mathematics to address issues of beauty and proportion. Mathematics has given rise to poetic metaphors for such concerns. Sculptor Polykleitos invented the ideal male nude, showing the scale and proportion of Euclid's approach to this theme. Art has embraced the golden ratio in architecture, architecture, painting, and sculpture. Mathematicians have written on problems of geometry, art, and aesthetics. Artists have created works inspired by Greek sculptures, Islamic art, Byzantine mosaic-tiles, German Expressionist Expressionist abstracts, and Modernist abstraction. A historical relationship has existed between mathematics and art for centuries. Artists have explored mathematical concepts through works as diverse as sculptures, paintings, glassblowing, textiles, fiber arts, and geometric patterns. Mathematics has influenced the visual arts through its application to sculpture, architecture, painting, glassblowing, textiles, fiber arts, and geometric patterns.\nMathematics and art are interconnected.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
        "output": "The Transformer model (originated by Vaswani et al. 2017) is a simple recurrent or convolutional neural network that uses positional embeddings to map words to neighboring positions within the text and applies attention mechanisms to maintain context within each word. It outperforms the previous leading models on two machine translation tasks with both small and limited training data, achieving over 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German Translation task and better than previous single-model state-of-the-art results on the WMT 2014 English-to-French Translation task."

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

Quantum computers provide access to the global database (state vector) and can solve problems such as Matrix Product States (MPS) and Quantum Gates, which are the two key components allowing Quantum Computers to perform operations on matrices and sequences, efficiently, than classical computers that treat data as a string of digits. Quantum Computing works by solving problems with matrices, gates, and sequences rather than the sum of operations performed by classical computers at the end of the line. Quantum computing leverages special gates and sequences called quantum-mechanical systems to solve problems much faster than classical computers.
