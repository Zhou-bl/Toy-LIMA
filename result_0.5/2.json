According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of jobs created after innovation is higher than the population.\n\n2. Economic growth: Innovation is a driver of economic growth. It creates new ideas, stimulate investment, and create new jobs. All these contribute to the overall growth of the economy.\n\n3. Redistribution of wealth: As innovation occurs, its attendant wealth creates new market opportunities for poor and vulnerable people. This, in turn, leads to the redistribution of wealth among the population.\n\n4. Sense of achievement: Innovation is a feeling of achievement. When people have new ideas, they feel a sense of responsibility to share them with the world. This, in turn, leads to the protection of private property and the improvement of social welfare.\n\n5. Global consciousness: Innovators think about the whole world instead of just their own backyard. This, in turn, leads to new ways of thinking about issues such as globalization, trade, and the role of nations in the world."
